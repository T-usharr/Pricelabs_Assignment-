# Pricelabs_Assignment

This repository contains my take-home assignment as an Associate Product Manager (APM). The task focused on analyzing the adoption and usage patterns of a newly launched **“Shared Templates”** feature.

## 📊 Objective

To understand why the **Shared Templates** feature has low adoption despite launch, and to:

- Analyze anonymized usage data
- Identify user behaviors and usage segments
- Propose success metrics
- Recommend product improvements (short-term and long-term)
- Deliver a Product Requirements Document (PRD)
